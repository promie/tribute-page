# Mark Zuckerberg Tribute Page

This project is purely written in just HTML and Bootstrap 3 (CDN).
It is the very first project that I've accomplished using Boostrap and the first project for Free Code Camp.

The Bootstrap classes that I've learnt and that was applied to this product are as follow:

* jumbotron
* thumbnail
* caption
* blockquote
* cite
