              <h3>Here's a time line of Mark Zuckerberg's life:</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>1984</strong> - Born in White Plains, New York, the
                  only son of a dentist and psychiatrist (he has three sisters).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2002</strong> - Graduates from Phillips Exeter
                  Academy, a private school in New Hampshire; joins Harvard
                  University in autumn on a psychology and computer science
                  course.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2003</strong> - Launches Facemash - a web programme
                  enabling Harvard students to compare images of same-gender
                  students and rate the more attractive - and nearly gets kicked
                  out when its immediate popularity draws the attention of the
                  university administrators.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2004</strong> - Starts Thefacebook.com in February.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2004</strong> - Drops out of Harvard at the end of his
                  sophomore year; moves to Palo Alto that summer, where he rents
                  a house with a now-famous swimming pool (and zip-wire).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2004</strong> - Facebook hits 200,000 users; contacts
                  venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, and receives an initial
                  investment of half a million dollars - some of which is used
                  to splash out on a small office above a Chinese restaurant
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2004</strong> - The Winklevoss twins file a lawsuit
                  against Zuckerberg claiming he ripped off their idea for a new
                  social network, HarvardConnection (later ConnectU).
                </li>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - Facebook hits 5 million users.</li>

                <li>
                  <strong>2007</strong> - Opens Facebook beyond universities so
                  anyone with an email address can join; turns down a $15
                  billion offer from Microsoft, which would have bagged him
                  personally $4 billion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2007</strong> - Allows independent developers to write
                  programmes for Facebook; but is forced to apologise when
                  Beacon, a controversial new addition to Facebook allowing

                  raises major complaints over privacy intrusion.

                  <strong>2008</strong> - Reaches a settlement with Winklevoss
